*Working with Variables and Data* 

To write text into the document as the page loads, use document.write(). This method allows you to create a text which is written to the window as the script is executed. 
The Write method is a member of the document object, which is not the default object. 
The window object is the default object. 
Every object that is not the default object, needs to be referred to explicitly like so...
	objectName.methodName();
	objectName.propertyName;
	

*Variables* 
A variable is a space of memory. 
A Data type is the type of information that a variable holds. JS provides 2 data types, primitive and non primitive. 
Primitive. 
there are 5 primitive data types. 
String, number, Boolean, null (value does not exist), undefined (value created but no value is assigned). 
Non-primitive(complex) data types 
Array, object. 

A Literal is the syntactic representation of the data 
JS naming variables 
Valid = letter, dollar sign. underscore. 
invalid = number, question mark, @ symbol. (no dots in name)

Js uses camelCase 
JS is case-sensitive. 

dot notation is a reference that is used to access a property or method of an object. 
You do not need to explicitly declare variables in JS 

Variables which are assigned to another variable. 
var userName1 = "Juan";
var userName2 = userName1;
If userName1 changes value, this does not affect userName2

*Variable scope* 

In JS, variables can have local or global scope. 
local = defined in function 
global = outside of function 
 
if variable is declared using let, it has block scope.
let variables are hoisted to the top of their current function 
Const variables has block scope. Their values cannot change. 
use uppercase when declaring const variables. 


*operators*
operator are used to store or return values. 
operands represent a piece of data that is manipulated in some way. 


=== means strict comparison. The value must be equal AND the same data type. 

quiz definitions: 
document.write = dynamically writes text to a window as the script is executed 
confirm() = requests true or false answer from a user and captures the reply 
prompt() = request info from user 
alert() = communicates a statement to a user that appears when the script is executed 


The question mark 

Condition to test ? Value if true: value if false 

Assignment operators. 

all operators become assignment operators when placed in front of the = sign. 

tofixed(num) = converts a number into string
